# Online-store
Online store, written in html, css, js and python using the flask framework. It is an online reptile and plant store. There are some things left to add, but I didn't want to do it so that everyone can add it according to their convenience. ALL: Product view page, payment system, custom 404 error page. Optional: In the footer you will find a section that says contact, you can put a link to a contact form, it is found on line 14 of /templates/ footer.html . There is an admin panel, to access enter the /admin address once the local server is running. There you can create, modify and delete products. In addition there is a blog system and a user system. The two databases (the user and product database) have been programmed thanks to the sqlite3 python library, therefore they are local databases.
